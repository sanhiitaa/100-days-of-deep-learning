# 100 Days of Deep Learning

Documenting my Deep Learning journey for referencing purposes and to organize better. 

## Sites and playlists I am following for the same: 
100 days of deep learning by CampusX - (https://youtu.be/2dH_qjc9mFg?si=Q_WeDma6afvISqlb)[Youtube Playlist]

## Also have a look at:
(https://github.com/sanhiitaa/100-days-of-deep-learning/blob/main/deep_learning_cookbook.ipynb)[Deep Learning Cookbook]: Curated code snippets and practical examples for various deep learning concepts learned while learning from the playlist mentioned above, created to aid learning and provide quick reference. 

(I will keep updating here as and when I find new sources)
